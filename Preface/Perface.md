## Where can i use interfaces?
These interfaces can be used  directly or indirectly, by every program that runs on Linux. They allow applications to perform tasks such as file I/O, creating and deleting files and directories, creating new processes, executing programs, setting timers, communicating between processes and threads on thesame computer, and communicating between processes residing on different computers connected via a network.

## Linux and UNIX
UNIX is Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX), Most UNIX implementations are present in linux and vica versa,but linux also has nonstandard extensions in order to performance reasons or to access functionality which isn't avaliable in the stanfarad UNIX programming interface  **(All UNIX implementations provide nonstandard extensions for these reasons.)**

***Ex for nonstandarad features:***
- **epoll**, a mechanism for obtaining notification of file I/O events;
- **inotify**, a mechanism for monitoring changes in files and directories;
- **capabilities**, a mechanism for granting a process a subset of the powers of the superuser.
